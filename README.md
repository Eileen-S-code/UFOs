# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
This project was to create a webpage and dynamic table that provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for date, the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 
For the new website one can now easily input additional search criteria for the find specific sighting

Once the filters are applied the results will be displayed in the output table

## Summary: 
In this project data can be filtered to find differen incidences of UFO sightings. One drawback to the new design is that there ris now longer a filter button. Two updates could be some kind of drop down menu that shows available options for the city, state, country, and shape and the second upate would be an input section to report a new sighting.
